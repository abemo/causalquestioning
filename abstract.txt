  It can be said that the success of the human species is largely attributed to our unrivaled communicative capabilities.
While the sheer bandwidth of human language provides large quantities of data transfer, it is intelligent and accurate
inference on communicated information that drives our prosperity and adaptability as a social, cooperative species.

  In this paper, I apply causal reinforcement learning--a model-based RL approach--to multi-agent communication across divergent agent environments.
A computer model was constructed to compare the effect of different communication policies.
The results of simulation demonstrates the superiority of an agent who can 1) induce causal differences between
her own and another agent's environment and 2) deduce useful information from divergent data via 
by "transport" adjustment formulae described by Bareinboim and Pearl.




communication and adaptability are the foundations of human-like intelligence and the success of our species.

Communication is the foundati

In this paper, I demonstrate the utility and superiority of causal model-based reinforcement learning in multi-agent
peer communication in the presence of divergent environments.
